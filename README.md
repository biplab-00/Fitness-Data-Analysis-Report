# Fitness-Data-Analysis-Report
This project, Fitness Data Analysis Report, is an end-to-end analytics solution built using PostgreSQL for database creation, modelling, and data management, and Microsoft Power BI for visualization and interactive reporting. It tracks analyses different fitness metrics like Total Workouts, Total Steps, Workout Intensity Index, Total Workout Duration, Heart rate ranges and Sleep hours with breakdown of performances by Age group, Gender and Activity type. The dashboard integrates KPIs, line charts, bar charts, gauges and matrix to uncover various insights like most effective activity for maximum calories burn, average calories burn, average heart rate, average sleep hours and targets, most engaging age groups with various activities, seasonal variations in activities and steps ultimately enabling personalized program design, demographic-specific engagement strategies, and actionable recommendations for optimizing health outcomes and user consistency.

                                       This project, “Fitness Data Analysis Report” has been done with the dataset ’random_fitness_dataset’ (Downloaded from Kaggle.com). At first the data was prepared and dimension tables were created in PostgreSQL and then the main dataset and the dimension tables were loaded to Microsoft Power Bi by connecting the SQL database. In Microsoft Power Bi the data were further cleaned and finally prepared for visualization.
